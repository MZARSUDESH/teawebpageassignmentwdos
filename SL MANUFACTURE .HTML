     <h1>The Tea Manufacturers</h1>
     <p>The tea farmers and manufacturers of Sri Lanka are the defenders of the old, orthodox way of growing black tea. This is already agreed to produce the finest black tea by most experts.
          The orthodox system is comparatively sluggish and labor-intensive, even with the technical changes adopted over the last thirty or forty years; but decent tea can not be rushed, 
          as the tea planters and traders of Sri Lanka have always maintained. Nor should it,
          interestingly enough be postponed. 
          If a quality product is to be obtained, the time dedicated to each of the tea processing processes must be finely judged. This is a matter of the decision of the tea-maker, 
          since the correct timing depends on the plucked leaf's moisture content, 
          the temperature and humidity conditions that prevail throughout the production period.
          And a host of other variables. While the method of producing fine black tea is basic in its essentials, 
          it is utterly important for success to have knowledge, experience and a 'feel' for the job.</p>
