     <h1><b>THE TYPES OF TEA</b></h1>
     <br>
     <p1>In the leaf, the infusion of the brewed coffee and the brewed liquor, going through the aroma of the tea both 
        leaf and liquor and finally to the benefit, form and power of each tea, the variety of tea is elegantly reflected visually. 
        Due to the slight variations that occur even within a single tea garden and the drastic distinctions between 
        tea from various regions and tea produced in different types, the diversity in tea is equivalent to any beverage.
        This versatility is at the root of tea luxury and is exceptionally distinctive because 
        the differences in the eye, nose and tongue come from the leaves of one plant.-<b>Camellia Sinensis</b>

    <td>White Tea</td>
    <td>For the discerning tea drinker, white tea, known in Sri Lanka as Silver Tips, is among the most rare and refined of teas. 
        While much of the "White Tea" called tea around the world is simply 
        a combination of a negligible sum of white tea and green or black teas, 
        true white tea preserves a particular appearance of a silvery leaf, with a velvety feel and when brewed, creates a vivid, golden liquor.
    </td>
    <td>Everyone today, from cooks to medical experts, praises the taste of white tea and its supposed health advantages, which 
      is why we have seen white tea items hit the shop shelves and find a spot on menus for drinks. 
      A high number of antioxidants, as well as 
      polyphenols, flavonoids, and tannins are found in white tea. 
      Such dietary advantages have a beneficial 
      impact on our wellness and fitness.
      It has been shown that white tea protects the body from 
      many illnesses and reduces the risk of cancer and cardiovascular conditions.

<tr>
  <td>Green tea</td>
  <td>Green tea from China, also grown in Japan, Vietnam, Taiwan and increasingly in India and Sri Lanka, is unfermented, retaining usually moderate, light and often astringent properties. 
    Until drying and sifting, the leaf is picked, withered, heated and then rolled. 
    Several separate methods represent distinctive practices in parts of China, 
    Taiwan and Japan for making green tea. 
    Sencha, made using a process unique to Japan, is the most common tea in Japan.</td>
    <td>
      It has been shown that green 
      tea increases blood flow and reduces cholesterol. 
      Green tea helped to avoid a number of heart-related complications, from elevated 
      blood pressure to congestive heart failure, a 2013 study of several studies showed.
      In persons with diabetes, green tea 
      tends to help keep blood sugar steady. 
      Since catechins decrease blood pressure and cholesterol, they can help 
      protect against the harm that a high-fat diet can do.

<tr>
  <td>Black tea</td>
  <td>Black tea, the most common kind of tea from Sri Lanka, India, Kenya and other former British colonies, is completely fermented.
     To decrease moisture and make the leaf pliable, black tea is picked, shrivelled, then rolled, 
    fermented and dried (or red) before sifting.</td>
    <td>Black tea as a source of antioxidants is a primary field of interest.
      Antioxidants aid in fighting free radicals. Free radicals in the body are reactive molecules that
       arise from both natural processes and stresses on the environment.The risk of skin, breast, lung, and prostate cancers may be minimized by black tea.

<tr>
  <td>Oolong tea</td>
  <td>Oolong teas are slightly oxidized or fermented, ranging from light "Springtime Oolong Teas" that have a soft, 
    aromatic and moderate sweetness to heavier dark Oolongs that are woody, often earthy with strong fruit and sometimes caramelised notes. 
    Sometimes 3 leaves and a bud, withered,
     fermented, then heated, rolled and dried, the teas are picked.</td>
     <td>People who drink at least 10 ounces of oolong tea a week were shown to have lower chances of elevated overall levels of cholesterol,
        triglyceride, and LDL or 'poor' cholesterol.
        The same was also true of persons who consumed green and black teas in equal proportions.
      researches found that this teaa isgood for weight lost and heart diseases</td>
