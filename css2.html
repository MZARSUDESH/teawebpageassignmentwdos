<h1>THE FUTURE OF LANKAN TEA</h1>
<p1>We are proud of our tea journey in the last 150 years as a country. It has become a beverage that almost every Sri Lankan consumes and the industry has made a huge contribution to our economy. However,

<h1>The problems faced in the competive market for lion tea </h1>
<p2>We have manufactured our teas using conventional processing methods for the longest time. For the past 150 years, these labour intensive manufacturing 
    processes have not improved significantly and this has resulted in nearly stagnant production costs.
     These methods also produce conventional grades of tea that can be processed by any other country. 
    Other tea-producing countries such as India and Kenya have now used smarter machines to introduce processing methods that have reduced their cost of  production.</p2>

<h2>the issues of tea workers </h2>
<p3>At the bottom of Sri Lankan society, the descendants of tea plantation workers stay trapped. All of them prefer to work for a low daily wage in oppressive circumstances.</p3>
